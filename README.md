<b>Minimal Point-Of-Sale (POS) system for Atari ST in HiSoft BASIC</b>

I am an old bicycle tech (not a software guru) running a small bicycle repair shop.
For several years I used a too expensive and too feature-rich commercial POS package under Windows. Having played around with GFA-Basic during the Atari heydays, I decided early 2020 to code something that does what I need and nothing more.
Did an early version in Windows QB64. I wanted it to look like a TOS program, so I used the black Atari font on a white background.
<br>That made me realize nothing beats the real thing. Dug out my old MagiC-PC software (an excellent multi-tasking Atari-ST emulator dating from 1995), only to find out that the original GFA-Basic, nor its semi-official successor <a href="http://gfabasic.net">GBE</a>, don't run under MagiC. 
However, the (also excellent) HiSoft BASIC 2.1 from 1991 does work without any problems.
<br>I'm using the program now for about six months on a daily basis. Definitely not bug-free, but absolutely useable.
