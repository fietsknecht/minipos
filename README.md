Minimal Point-Of-Sale (POS) system for Atari ST in HiSoft BASIC

I am a bicycle tech (not a software guru) running a small bicycle repair shop.
For several years I used a too expensive and too feature-rich commercial POS package under Windows. Having played around with GFA-Basic during the Atari heydays, I decided early 2020 to code something that does what I need and nothing more.
