<b>Minimal Point-Of-Sale (POS) system for Atari ST in HiSoft BASIC</b>

I am an old bicycle tech (not a software guru) running a small bicycle repair shop.
For several years I used a too expensive and too feature-rich commercial POS package under Windows. Having played around with GFA-Basic during the Atari heydays, I decided early 2020 to code something that does what I need and nothing more.
Did an early version in Windows QB64. I wanted it to look like a TOS program, so I used the black Atari font on a white background.
<br>That made me realize nothing beats the real thing. Dug out my old MagiC-PC software (an excellent multi-tasking Atari-ST emulator dating from 1995), only to find out that the original GFA-Basic, nor its semi-official successor <a href="http://gfabasic.net">GBE</a>, don't run under MagiC. 
However, the (also excellent) HiSoft BASIC 2.1 from 1991 does work without any problems. That was my weapon of choice to create MINIPOS.TOS.
<br>I'm using the MINIPOS program now for about six months on a daily basis. Definitely not bug-free, but absolutely useable.

<b>Quick start</b>

The binary directory contains the most recent MINIPOS.PRG. It requires the included directories DATA and RECEIPTS. 
The DATA directory contains sample files needed by the program.
Receipts will be stored in the RECEIPTS directory.
<br>The program should run on any Atari (or Atari emulator) that can display 80x25 chars in 4 colours.
