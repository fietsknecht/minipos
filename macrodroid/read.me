MiniPOS can activate a webhook to handle payment processing on an Android device. You will need a scripting app like MacroDroid.
This is an example macro for MacroDroid for Android. The macro is triggered by MacroDroid's webhook for your device. It wil start the SumUp (the payment provider I use) app and punch in the value of the parameter 'amount' as passed by the webhook url. Put the macro on your device and load it from inside MacroDroid. Then you can adjust it to your needs.
